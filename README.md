# Frontend Mentor Challange: IP Location Tracker(React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS) ðŸ§¨

This website allows you to Track the location of an IP Address. It displays a bit of info on that IP. The location displayed is only a general location.

This was built with the Geo Ipify API for tracking the location: https://geo.ipify.org/
and for pinning the location on the map I used LeafletJS API: https://leafletjs.com/reference.html
